# twitter-reply-bot
A simple twitter bot to reply tweets!


To create the bot, you need to create a [twitter application](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Then you must generate the tokens and keys of the account.

To configure the bot you just have to fill in the fields in bot-config.js, using the tokens, the keys and the keywords or hashtags that the bot will retweet.

And that's it, just run **node bot.js**
